Introduction:

FlankFasta is a script for the transformation of FASTA files in FASTA
files optimized for performing Phylogenetic Analysis. This is done
relying on Tcoffee for performing sequence and structural alignment
(where PDB candidate templates are available) and Gblocks for the
elimination of not-well-conserved alignment regions.


Requirements:

Make sure to have all following softwares installed:
- Yaml (http://yaml.org/)
- Tcoffee (https://github.com/cbcrg/tcoffee)
  configured with Mafft, Probcons, Muscle
- Gblocks (http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks.html)


Usage:

Divide your FASTA files in two directories, one holding all nucleic
acid sequence files, and the other holding all amino acid sequence
files.
If you have nucleic acid sequence files whose sequences belong to
coding DNA genes and you want to translate them into protein
sequences, then translate them using your preferred software (i.e.
Seaview), and keep them ordered in the amino acid sequence file
directory.
Launch the executable with no options to see a brief help about
FlankFasta's usage.


How it works:

Nucleic acid sequences are aligned via Tcoffee sequence alignment,
while amino acid sequences are first compared against PDB for a
candidate template extraction, and then aligned using Tcoffee
structural alignment.
Both alignments undergo a Gblocks optimization, which shrinks the
original sequence/structural alignment to their most conserved
regions (flanks).
The result files for these operations are hold in the flanked FASTA
files, named *_flanked.fasta.



TODO: Gblocks parameters are not tweakable
